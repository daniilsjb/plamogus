## Building

To run this project locally, you will need to start up the database, backend, and frontend of the application.

### Prerequisites

There are several options for building this project, but ultimately you will most likely need the following:

- [Docker][1] or a local installation of [PostgreSQL][2]
- Java 17 SDK
- [npm][3]

You may perform all of the steps using a terminal, or use an IDE such as [IntelliJ IDEA][4], which works for both Spring
and React projects. If you don't have Docker installed, you may wish to consider using [Docker Desktop][5], which comes
with all necessary software and a graphical user interface.

### Starting the Database

This project uses PostgreSQL database management system. To run the application, you can either start a database server
using Docker or by manually running the DBMS on your machine.

#### Using Docker (Recommended)

The simplest way to start the database container is via the provided [`docker-compose.yml`](./server/docker-compose.yml)
configuration file. Assuming you are in the root of the repository, simply run the following:

```sh
cd server
docker-compose up
```

This will take care of pulling the necessary image and setting up the environment variables, exposed ports, etc.
Alternatively, you may explicitly run the equivalent Docker command yourself:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name plamogus_db \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=plamogus \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=plamogus_user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=plamogus_user \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres
```

#### Manually

Create a new database server using the PostgreSQL package and configure it with the following settings (applicable to
local environments only):

| Setting       | Value           |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Database Name | `plamogus`      |
| Username      | `plamogus_user` |
| Password      | `plamogus_user` |
| Host          | `localhost`     |
| Port          | `5432`          |

### Starting the Server

Before running the server, ensure that the database has started successfully.

#### Using IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)

Simply open the `server` project in the IDE and run it - IntelliJ will automatically take care of dependencies, etc.
If you do not have a suitable Java 17 SDK, you may [download one directly from the IDE][6] (such as the Amazon Corretto
version of OpenJDK).

To verify that the server has started correctly, you may try running samples from the [`examples`](./server/examples/)
folder using [IntelliJ's built-in HTTP client][7] after selecting the `local` environment profile. Don't forget to
replace `{id}` with the actual identifiers when making requests!

#### Using Terminal

If you prefer building from the command-line, you may use the provided `mvnw` script to build and run the project.
Ensure that the path to your Java 17 SDK is specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

If you are on Windows, execute the following commands:

```sh
cd server
.\mvnw.cmd clean install
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

If you are on Linux or macOS, execute the following commands:

```sh
cd server
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Starting the Client

Before running the client, ensure that the server has started successfully. The frontend may also be started from
IntellIJ IDEA, or using the following commands in a terminal:

```sh
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

At this point, the entire application stack should be up and running. Open up your web browser and navigate to
`localhost:3000/` to try it out!
